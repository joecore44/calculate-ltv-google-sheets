# Transaction Grouping and LTV Calculation

This JavaScript logic is designed to process a collection of transactions and perform various calculations to determine the Lifetime Value (LTV) of customers over a 6-month period. The process involves grouping transactions based on their unique Credit Card (CC) numbers, counting the number of transactions in each group, calculating the sum of the transaction amounts in each group, and finally, deriving the LTV and the average transaction size for the 6-month period.

# How It Works
Grouping Transactions: The JavaScript code takes an input dataset of transactions and groups them based on their unique Credit Card (CC) numbers. Each group will contain transactions belonging to the same credit card.

Counting Transactions: Within each group, the code calculates the total number of transactions associated with the corresponding credit card.

Calculating Total Sum: For each group, the logic determines the sum of the transaction amounts. This sum represents the total amount spent by the customer associated with the credit card.

Calculating Average of Total Sum: Next, the code calculates the average transaction amount based on the total sum value for each group. This provides an insight into the average spending behavior of customers with respect to each credit card.

Calculating 6-Month LTV: To derive the 6-month Lifetime Value (LTV) for each credit card, the logic averages the average transaction amounts from step 4. This results in an estimation of how much revenue a customer generates over a 6-month period.

Calculating Average Transaction Size: Additionally, the code provides an average transaction size for the 6-month period. This value indicates the average amount spent per transaction across all customers during this period.

# How to Use
To use this JavaScript logic, follow these steps:

Prepare your dataset of transactions in JSON format, ensuring each transaction includes the unique Credit Card (CC) number and the transaction amount.

Replace the placeholder JSON object in the code with your actual dataset.

Run the script in a JavaScript environment or integrate it into your project as needed.

Review the output to obtain the calculated 6-month LTV and the average transaction size based on the provided dataset.

# Example
For clarity, a sample input dataset and corresponding output are provided in the code comments. You can use this example to verify that the logic is functioning correctly with your dataset.

# Dependencies
This JavaScript logic does not have any external dependencies and can be executed in any modern JavaScript environment.
